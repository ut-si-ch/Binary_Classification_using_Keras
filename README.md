# Binary Classification using Keras

This project demonstrates how to build a binary classification model using Keras, a high-level deep learning API running on top of TensorFlow. Binary classification is a fundamental machine learning task in which the goal is to classify data points into one of two categories.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a neural network that can accurately classify input data into one of two categories, such as:

- Spam vs. Not Spam
- Fraudulent vs. Legitimate Transactions
- Tumor: Malignant vs. Benign
- Customer Churn: Yes vs. No

This project showcases a deep learning approach to solving such problems using Keras' Sequential API.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of numerical features with a binary target label (`0` or `1`). Key steps include:

- **Loading data**: From CSV or dataset repository
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Handling missing values
  - Feature normalization or standardization
  - Encoding target labels (if needed)
- **Splitting data** into training and test sets

> This project is adaptable to any standard binary classification dataset.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

A simple feed-forward neural network using Keras:

- **Input Layer**: Accepts all features
- **Hidden Layers**: One or more Dense layers with ReLU activation
- **Output Layer**: One neuron with a **sigmoid** activation function
- **Loss Function**: Binary Crossentropy
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Metrics**: Accuracy

## 📈 Evaluation

Model performance is assessed using:

- **Accuracy**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Precision, Recall, F1-score**
- **Loss and Accuracy curves** across epochs

These help identify overfitting, underfitting, and overall model performance.
